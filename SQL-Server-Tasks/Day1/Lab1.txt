(Note that the Identification number is unique)  

Problem 1
Musicana records have decided to store information on musicians who perform on their albums in a database. The company has wisely chosen to hire you as a database designer.
• Each musician that is recorded at Musicana has an ID number, a name, an address (street, city) and a phone number.
• Each instrument that is used in songs recorded at Musicana has a unique name and a musical key (e.g., C, B-flat, E-flat).
• Each album that is recorded at the Musicana label has a unique title, a copyright date, and an album identifier.
• Each song recorded at Musicana has a unique title and an author.

Problem 4
Major airlines companies that provide passenger services keep database with lots of information on all airlines.

2. Each employee works in Airline Company has an employee identification number, name, address, birthday recorded as (day, month, year), gender, position with the company, and qualifications.

3. Each airline owns different aircrafts. For each aircraft an aircraft identification number, capacity, and model is recorded.

4. The aircrafts are assigned to different routes. An aircraft can work on more than one route and a route has many aircrafts going on it. Some information as number of passengers, price per passenger, departure date time, arrival date time and the time that aircraft spent in travelling the route are recorded.

Each route has a route identification number, origin, destination, distance,classification (e.g. domestic or international route).

Draw an E-R diagram for the database presented above.
